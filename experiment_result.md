# Implementation

## Folksong Records

A folksong record in Essen Folksong database contains following columns:

- Name of its subsection
- Title
- ... (待補完)

For simplification, in ours implementation, we only keep the nesseccary columns in  record. These are:

- Name of its subsection
- Title
- ... (待補完)


## Content-Query Method

We implement two method to query folksong record by it content:

- By Jianpu representation
- By MusicNote sequence representation

# Experiment

## Simulation of User Input Fault


### Simulation of User Input Fault in Jianpu Representation


### Simulation of User Input Fault in MusicNote Sequence Representation


## Result
